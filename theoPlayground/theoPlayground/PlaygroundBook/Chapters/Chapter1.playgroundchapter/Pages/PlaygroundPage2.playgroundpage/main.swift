 # The Wall
 - Note:
 Bowe got upset with something Darwin said. He wants to start a conversation about it, but...

 In many life situations, opening yourself to someone might feel very threatening. Your mind creates insecurities to stop you, like a giant wall that blocks every attempt of communication. Keeping things to yourself may seem easier, but we know it's not worth it.

 After a lot of effort, you will break the wall. The next challenge is avoiding being misunderstood. You need to speak as clear as possible, getting rid of all communication noises. Let's **BLOW** these noises away!

 Please, hit "Run My Code" to help Bowe!
